2021.6.8.685
Hello everyone, a smaller build this time, I'm spending more time poking around BEPUv2 now, but there are some goodies anyway! Leg haptics are now supported! (specifically for bHaptics right now, but it's generalized) Also some new nodes and changes to make it easier to work with Nullable values. There's more to do with those, but hopefully these help a bit already! A bunch of additions for the Context Menu Injection too (filtering primary/secondary and tools)!

New Features:
- Added support for leg haptics (requested by @Rue Shejn | Artist 3D, @Aegis_Wolf | Creative Director and @Ryuvi | Technical Artist on behalf of bHaptics)
-- Added LegHapticPointMapper which maps the haptics of avatar's leg to the haptic device (existing avatars are auto-initialized)
-- Legs are mapped from hips to angle (position along 0...1) with angular offset from the front facing (where knee/foot is facing) going left (negative) and right (positive)
-- Added support for bHaptics Foot mapping
- Added PackNullable and UnpackNullable nodes (under Operators/Nullable) (based on general feedback)
-- These allow you to unpack (get whether value exists and the value itself) and pack (set whether value exists and the value itself) of nullable struct types
- Added "Exclude On Tools" to RootContextMenuItem which allows excluding the option from being injected when opened with a hand that has active tool (requested by @Electronus)
- Added "Exclude Primary/Secondary Hand" to RootContextMenuItem which allows excluding the option based on whether it was opened with user's primary or secondary hand (requested by @Shadow Panther [RU/EN, UTC+3])
- Added "Reverse" input to the For node, which will run the loop backwards (requested by @Gawdl3y, @Shadow Panther [RU/EN, UTC+3] and bentallea)
Tweaks:
- Nullable type wires now use the color of the base type, but semi-transparent
-- We'll very likely change this when the visuals are fully redesigned, but it'll take some time to get to that
- Changed context menu Sprite reference to use more general IAssetProvider<Sprite> rather than specifically the SpriteProvider component
-- This fixes ValueOptionDescriptionDriver, ReferenceOptionDescriptionDriver and other components that use more general references and drives not working with ContextMenuItemSource and other parts of the system (reported by @Shadow Panther [RU/EN, UTC+3] and @seif1)
- DynamicVariableInput node name is now consistent with rest of the dynamic variable nodes and uses nice name (reported by RobertBaruch)
- Avatar heuristics will no longer detect "UnderEye" as eye bone (reported by @Sveny)

Bugfixes:
- All variable nodes now initialize proper default values (e.g. floatQ is initialized to identity, rather than an invalid rotation quaternion) (based on report by @Shifty | Quality Control Lead)
- ButtonValueSet<T> and ButtonValueShift<T> now initialize proper default values for all their fields (same as above) (reported by @Shifty | Quality Control Lead, @Ian Corvid)

2021.6.9.396
A tiny patch, mainly re-adding fix for legs jumping up that accidentally got reverted, new MTC strings for the upcoming release and some default generic types for some components! I'll be working on some bigger things and I'm not sure how long it'll take, so I wanted to get this out ASAP.

Compatible with previous build, don't need to update right away (unless you have the glitchy legs problem and you want to get rid of it).

Tweaks:
- Merged MTC Streaming Room Locale strings by @Rue Shejn | Artist 3D
- Added default generic version templates for several components (added by @ProbablePrime | Docs)
-- ButtonValueSet/Cycle/Shift
-- ValueOptionDescriptionDriver
-- DynamicValueVariableReset
-- ValueDriver
-- ValueTextFormatDriver

Bugfixes:
- Re-added fix for Slerp function that got accidentally reverted in the last build
-- This should re-fix the avatar legs randomly jumping up (regression reported by @Cael Thunderwing and @Earthmark)
