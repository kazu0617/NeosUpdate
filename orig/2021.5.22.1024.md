2021.5.22.1024
Another small build sorry! Just handling some smaller tasks and such right now. It has some goodies too though, like material batch conversion! There are some more security improvements too and a bunch of bugfixes and polish for desktop and other things.

New Features:
- Added Batch Material conversion feature to the Material Tooltip when holding a slot reference, which allows converting all materials in the hierarchy to specific material type (requested by @Veer | Chief Moderation Officer)
- If you double-click the right mouse button in third person mode, the character's forward direction will align with the view as well 

Tweaks:
- Improved security if favorite avatars using scoped temporary access keys
-- Favorited avatar records are no longer marked as public to severely mitigate possibility of malicious access
-- In a few days we'll automatically unmark all avatar records as public unless they're in a public folder
-- Note that when unregistered user hosts, they won't be able to load private favorited avatars for you, you'll have to equip them yourself
- Removed old logging code for opening worlds
- ToString on fields will now always act as doing ToString on the field value
- Material conversion dialog positioning is now consistent with other dialogs and respects different camera modes
- Extracting all material orbs from hierarchy is now undoable
- Upgraded youtube-dl to 2021.05.16 from 2021.04.01
- Upgraded various internal dependencies and libraries for both cloud and client to latest versions

- Merged German locale additions (including MTC Streamer Room) and fixes by @3x1t_5tyl3
- Merged Russian locale addition by @Shadow Panther [RU/EN, UTC+3]
- Merged Korean locale update and fix by @MirPASEC
Bugfixes:
- Fixed InventoryLink generating context menu item when disabled (reported by @Ukilop)
- Fixed ValueMultiplexer and ReferenceMultiplexer throwing exceptions when Index is invalid and driven value is being written back (based on log provided by @Enverex)
- Fixed 48-bit source textures (e.g. PNG) being washed out when exported due to tonemapping running on them (reported by @Cataena and @Lucaedr )
- Added a guard against TwitchChatDialog throwing lots of exceptions when parts of it are removed (based on report and log by @RezilloRyker)
- Fixed UI Aligned Camera mode not properly transforming the camera orientation when aligning items, resulting in items being misaligned when they're parented under a slot with rotation offset (reported by @Epsilion, @Axius, @3x1t_5tyl3)
- Fixed text renderer auto-sizing not respecting BoundsAlignment when performing last iteration bounds alignment, resulting in random small offsets of the resulting text (based on report and sample by @Enverex)
- Fixed components that destroy the user on unhandled exception (e.g. CommonTool) not actually destroying user, resulting in logspam and corrupt behaviors (found in a log from @AlienInArea51 (MR-Alex))
-- If you encounter case like this during normal operation, please make a bug report! However if you are messing with internals of those components and deleting necessary working objects, this behavior can be normal and you should find alternate approach that won't rely on corrupting internal state, as we won't necessarily support such use-cases
