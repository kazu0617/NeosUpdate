2021.6.14.1031
Hello everyone, just another small build sorry! Still focusing mostly on BEPUv2, but there are some small additions, improvements and some security improvements based on community reports, as well as fixed strings for the MTC Streaming & Recording Hall.

New Features:
- Added "Hidden" to ContextMenuSubmenu, which will only render the context menu to its owner when opened (requested by Iforgotwhosorry ;_;)
-- IMPORTANT: This is purely cosmetic and not a security mechanism to prevent tampering. If you want security, put your UI in Userspace and use cloud variables to sync to world
- Neos will now automatically reload locale when the files are changed, making it easier to preview translation changes live (requested by @3x1t_5tyl3)
-- Note that this follows same rules as switching locale - certain strings will not be updated immediatelly and will require regenerating the UI (e.g. Context Menu needs to be reopened)
- Added LinearColorMapper (requested by @Honzackcz and @Shadow Panther [RU/EN, UTC+3])

Tweaks:
- "Turn off UI Edit mode" and "Remove All Instances" on SimpleAvatarProtection are now localizable
- WebsocketClient now respects the "Enabled" property and will disconnect when disabled (reported by @Delta)
- Read/Write Cloud variable LogiX nodes now have nice names showing the actual type name (based on report by @Lexevo)
- When attaching UIX Mask, Image will be attached automatically as well if no graphic component currently exists (suggested by @3x1t_5tyl3)
- Merged fixed MTC locale strings by @Rue Shejn | Artist 3D
- Upgraded youtube-dl to 2021.06.06 from 2021.05.16
- Merged Esperanto locale overhaul by @Yellow and @Inferus
- Merged Japanese locale additions (including new MTC Streaming Hall) and tweaks by @Aesc
- Merged Korean locale additions (including new MTC Streaming Hall) and tweaks by @Titancube, @MirPASEC and @R3C0D3r 
- Merged Russian locale additions (including new MTC Streaming Hall) and tweaks by @Shadow Panther [RU/EN, UTC+3]
- Merged Icelandic locale additions (including welcome page) and tweaks by @Nammi
- Merged British English locale additions by @Nammi

Security
- Added delegate validation, which allows referencing only methods that are part of the data model and avoids running undesired actions (e.g. directly requesting Neos shutdown) (reported by @ThomFox, @guillefix, @Cyro and others)
-- This shouldn't affect any official existing Neos functionality. If you notice any actions broken, please send us a report and corresponding log file. Any methods assigned via hacks will however break.
- SimpleAvatarProtection now asks for confirmation when being removed

Bugfixes:
- Fixed counting of present contacts in a session sometimes throwing an exception when the current session info is null
- Fixed headless banById and banByName commands not checking if the user is already banned, causing the bans to stack (reported by @Glitch)
