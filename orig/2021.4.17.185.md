Hello everyone I've got a big batch of improvements for the third person mode! :smile: The camera now detects occlusion with world to avoid clipping through, its smarter when adjusting its position and the posing of the character has been improved too! For example you can now move with the camera being in front of the character without your avatar immediatelly turning their back on the camera (how dare!). A whole bunch of bugfixes should fix usability issues too.

Some more important fixes are in as well, notably crashes when switching to audio output device that has 96 kHz samplerate or higher - looks like the audio library doesn't like to do resampling on its end, so we're doing that ourselves now. As part of that I reworked the logic a bit, which might fix some of the glitchy audio that some users have been reporting, need more testing on that though!

The Ctrl+D, Ctrl+Shift+D and other shortcuts have been fixed as well, that one was a big trickier than thought, but has been solved by a good general addition to the Input Binding system, which can now block keys based on the order of pressing (Right Mouse Button -> Ctrl for grabbed item actions and Ctrl -> Right Mouse Button for camera control). It's part of why this build took a bit more, had this and few more gotcha's to deal with, sorry!

Oh also changed the temporary key for 3rd person mode to F5 for now instead of Alt. It's still temporary, so give me a bit to resolve some of the other camera modules before a proper binding falls in place!
New Features:
- Added support for ordered input gating to the input binding system, which avoid blocking inputs unless they're pressed in specific order
-- This fixes Ctrl+D, Ctrl+Shift+D and Ctrl+Shift+S not being usable to delete held objects after recent addition of Ctrl+Right Mouse button to pan camera (reported by @3x1t_5tyl3, @Toxic_Cookie and @AshtonSparx)
-- To pan the camera, you need to hold Ctrl first, while the right mouse button is released

- Added ButtonStringAppend component (Common UI/Button Interactions), which appends a string to a target string on button press (based on request by @Rue Shejn | Artist 3D and @Aegis_Wolf | Art Director)
-- It also supports appending in front
- Added ButtonStringErase component (Common UI/Button Interactions) which erases a specified Count of characters from target string on button press
-- It can erase them from both end and beginning

- Third person camera now detects occlusion with the environment and brings the camera closer to avoid clipping through the geometry (currently only looks for character colliders, might change the behavior to be a bit smarter)

- Implemented internal algorithm for processing CDFT batches in preparation for the upcoming 75th NCR batch (requested by @Karel | CEO)
- Implemented internal protection to accidental saves to the Neos Essentials and Essential Tools for the Neos Team
Tweaks:
- Camera does no longer move upwards when interacting in the 3rd person mode, only to the side
- Third person camera will now offset in the direction that the camera is panned on interaction, rather than direction determined by the primary hand
-- This fixes the camera moving to the other side of the character when interacting with things in some cases
- The third person camera offset on interaction is now proportional to the camera distance
- The character in third person mode will now face the camera when you swing it in front of them, rather than just keeping head straight
- The character in third person mode will now turn their body towards the interaction target if the angle difference is sufficiently large
-- This fixes the arm/hand being bent at awkward angles when moving grabbed items too close to the camera or interacting with things that go too far
- The character in third person mode will keep their facing direction when walking in directions that aren't aligned with the camera and will have small delay before they turn when walking forward
-- This makes it possible to move the character with the camera being in front of them, without them turning back
- Tweaked positioning of spawned dialogs in third person mode (some more refinement will still be applied to this, but should be better for now)
- Changed the key to switch between 1st and 3rd person to F5 for the time being (based on feedback by @3x1t_5tyl3 and @ProbablePrime)
-- Note that this is temporary change, the Alt key will be used in some way once more modes are added and refined, but this should eliminate some conflicts for now
- Tweaked look speeds in the third person mode
Bugfixes:
- Improved audio output device timing logic, which should improve cases where the audio becomes glitchy/stuttery (previously reported by @Jaiden#1262, @Shadow Panther [RU/EN, UTC+3])
- Fixed updating friend in the cloud (e.g. accepting friend request) breaking if the target friend never updated their current status (e.g. by logging into Neos) (discovered by @ProbablePrime)
- Fixed Neos crashing when selecting audio output device with high sampling rate (e.g. 96 kHz) (reported by @Shifty | Quality Control Lead, @Cyro, @Tatsu Kimiero, @Hayden, @httmj#3473, @あむ（Rabbuttz）, @Alex Thorin)
- Fixed audio samples processing breaking when trying to copy samples from a source that has none available
- Fixed some recurrent cloud validation jobs failing on certain accounts
- Fixed Angle measurement between two vectors occassionally producing NaN result when the input vectors are too similar
-- This might fix numerous subtle and random errors with existing behaviors and your custom ones as well
- Fixed debug test showing up in front of the head, instead of in front of the actual view
- Clamped minimum configurable FOV in the desktop mode, to avoid confusion when the value is accidentally set to 0 (based on report by @Fuzy Sidwell and @Shifty | Quality Control Lead)
- Fixed Userspace keyboard inputs becoming blocked after a focused element (e.g. text field on an inspector) in the world is destroyed, preventing opening dash (reported by @Shifty | Quality Control Lead and @Cyro)
- Fixed interaction start distance in third person mode not compensating for the current user's scale (this fixes interfaces and context menus not being usable when too small, as reported by @Shifty | Quality Control Lead, @epicEaston197 and @ChrisWarner103 (DelVR))
- Fixed Context Menu being positioned at wrong distances in third person mode when scaled up or down (based on report above)
