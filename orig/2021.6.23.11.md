2021.6.23.11
Hello everyone! Just a tiny build, I'm mostly working on BEPUv2 now, but here's a few small bits I did on the side to break up things a bit (and because I they're be fun to do) - some additions to existing shaders! They should give you a fair bit more flexibility for achieving certain effects.

Also there is now visually impaired badge based on community request, you can assign it to yourself with commands below if you like.

New Features:
- Added visually impaired accessibility badge
-- You can assign or unassign it by sending following commands to the Neos account: /addVisuallyImpaired, /removeVisuallyImpaired
-- Current badge image made by @Raith (CytraX) | Programmer, will likely be updated later

- Added "Worldspace View" projection mode to Projection 360 material
-- This works the same as "View", but ignores any rotation of the mesh
- Added Offset Texture and Offset Mask to Projection 360 material
-- These allow displacing the UV's of the projection (using mask to control strength in different parts as well) to allow for distortion and shimmering effects
-- OffsetMagnitude is in degrees along horizontal and vertical
-- OffsetMask R and G channels are multiplied with the offset magnitude to compute the final offset
- Added worldspace vertex offset map support to PBS Displace Materials
-- This applies offset to the vertex offset texture based on the XZ position in the world, allowing to vary the offset of the same item across the world (e.g. for plant movement, so it's not all synchronized)
-- The RG channels of the texture are used to offset the U and V when sampling the VertexDisplaceMap
-- By default, the XZ position is taken from the Slot position and shared across entire model. Enabling WorldspaceOffsetPerVertex will use position of each individual vertex
- You can now specify token on the TipJar component (requested by @MirPASEC and @Turk | Mentor Manager)

Tweaks:
- TipJar confirmation dialog text is now localizable
