2021.4.5.961
Small hotfix for the laser misbehaving due to scale in the avatar hierarchy, sorry!

Compatible with previous build.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed laser misbehaving due to incorrectly calculated scale when transforming point (reported by @あむ（Rabbuttz）, @Polaris (she/her), @MattyK, @Hayden, @Readun and @epicEaston197)

2021.4.5.1003
An extra patch to fix the smoothing speed of grabbed objects in some cases. Nothing serious, compatible with previous too, so don't need to update right away unless this bugs you.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed smoothing speed being higher when grabbing touchable objects, rather than only when the laser hits another touchable that's not being grabbed when assigning references (reported by @Alex Thorin)
