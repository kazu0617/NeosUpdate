A whole bunch of new goodies for the new desktop mode! You can now rotate items (GMod style!), scale them, scale yourself, take in-game photos (even with timer), save items to inventory and quick switch common tooltips. I've also changed a bunch of the existing bindings too (e.g. the Dash is now opened/closed simply by pressing Esc) and there's a whole bunch of other tweaks, improvements and bugfixes to make the new desktop mode more usable.

Currently it is still usable only by pressing F8 after launching in VR, but I'll be swapping it out within next few days, after adding a few more crucial things. It's coming along!

Also added a bunch of bugfixes to this one (including broken Reflection Probes on Linux, which turned out to be just a stupid typo in a flag when uploading HDR textures to GPU, sorry!) and some regressions (sorry for the inconvenience!). More to come soon!

New Features:
- Added "Save To Inventory" context menu option, which will save the held object to the current inventory folder
-- Note that you currently need to open inventory folder where you have write permissions first. This will be simplified with the upcoming inventory UI redesign
-- This also allows easily saving items in the new desktop mode

- Added an internal mechanism to load-equip and stash tooltips from an URL
-- Tooltips and other equippable items are now internally tagged as equippable when saved to inventory, which will allow future UI to allow one-click equip directly from inventory
-- When switching tooltips, if the current one is quick loaded, it will be "stashed" - disabled and hidden, preserving its state on the next equip in the same session
- You can now quick switch tooltips in the new desktop mode via tha alphanumeric keys. Bindings are following (the loadout will be customizable in the future):
-- 1 - Dequip
-- 2 - Developer Tip
-- 3 - LogiX Tip
-- 4 - Material Tip
-- 5 - Shape Tip
-- 6 - Light Tip
-- 7 - Grabbable Setter Tip
-- 8 - Character Collider Setter Tip
-- 9 - Microphone
-- 0 - Glue Tip

- You can now capture in-game photos in the new desktop mode
-- To capture instant photo, press Shift+P or Shift+PrintScreen
-- To start timer photo, press Ctrl+P or Ctrl+PrintScreen
-- The capture won't start until you release the combination, allowing you to hold it to see a preview

- You can now rotate held items in the new desktop mode
-- Hold the E key while holding an item and move the mouse around to rotate object around X and Y axes
-- Hold the Shift+E key to rotate only around the vertical axis
- You can now scale held items in the new desktop mode
-- Hold the Shift key while holding an item and use the mouse scroll wheel to scale it

- Added a mechanism to block inputs within InputGroup by specifying a priority level for each binding, simplifying setup of common control schemes (e.g. Ctrl+<Key>, Shift+<Key> and <Key> as modifiers)
- Reworked FingerPhotoGesture into a more general PhotoCaptureManager
Tweaks:
- Dash is opened/closed by the Escape key now in the new desktop mode
- The locomotion switch and scaling options are now shown on the context menu even with equipped tooltip
- Keyboard & Mouse input is now fully supressed while the dash is open in the desktop mode
- Lowered the limit of how close you can bring grabbed items to your viewpoint from 10 cm to 5 cm in the new desktop mode
- Increased vertical mouse look angle limit to 89 degrees from 80 to allow looking near straight up and straight down
- You can now use PageUp and PageDown to quickly cycle between active locomotion modules
-- This will have a visual at some later point, not too usable at this point just yet, but it's been added as part of larger work
- You can now self-scale in new desktop mode by holding Ctrl and using the Mouse Scroll button
-- Scaling still needs to be enabled first in the context menu
- Tweaked finger photo gesture supression level, to be more tolerant of bent fingers
- Developer Tooltip laser now considers Gizmo controls as preferred targets and will pass through other objects and stick to them (based on report by @H3BO3)
- Undo & Redo context menu options are not generated when holding items with the active hand

- Merged Japanese locale additions for the new MTC Avatar Lobby by @Aesc
- Merged Czech locale additions for the new MTC Avatar Lobby by @rampa_3 (UTC +1, DST UTC +2)
- Merged Korean locale tweaks by @MirPASEC
Bugfixes:
- Context menu positioning in the new desktop mode now properly handles user's scale
- Interaction Laser now consider user's current scale when ignoring near raycast hits
-- This fixes the context menu not being usable when the user scale is too small in the new desktop mode
- Fixed SyncType inspector field not accepting any type strings after recent changes (reported by @3x1t_5tyl3)
- Fixed incorrect flags being set for BC6H textures when uploading them to the GPU through OpenGL, resulting in the texture data to be interpreted incorrectly on Linux and Android
-- This fixes ReflectionProbes being overly bright on Linux (@Shifty | Quality Control Lead, @happysmash27, @Polychrome, Silvea12, Enverex and @Develon)
- Fixed favorite avatar, keyboard, camera and home being unfavorited on manual log out (reported by @Flame Soulis and @H3BO3)
- Fixed gamepad mouse look being framerate dependent (reported by @Lewis Snow | Lead Audio Engineer)
- Fixed regression breaking the context menu flick functionality (reported by @Flame Soulis, @DeliriousJax, @ohzee, @H3BO3 and @Turk)
- Fixed regression when aligning laser-held objects to the vertical axis having a small offset from the aligned position, depending on the hand movement speed (reported by @orange)
