**2021.5.6.453**
A whole bunch of additions and improvements for the UI Aligned Camera mode! Interacting with items and working with LogiX should now be much friendlier and easier to do (check #devlog channel for some examples) and some bugs have been fixed. Sorry that there's not much else apart from a few other tweaks and fixes, got some other things to deal with today, but hopefully this brings the new camera mode to it's proper potential!

Also this build is compatible with previous one, so you don't need to update right away, though it's recommended as soon as you can!

New Features:
- Aligning grabbed items in the UI Aligned Camera mode now alignes them exactly to the current camera plane (both position and rotation)
-- This makes it very easy to align nodes and other interfaces within a plane
- Interfaces and other elements get positioned on the current plane in the UI Aligned Camera mode when spawned/opened
- Deleting LogiX wires now works properly in UI Aligned Camera mode
- Grabbing objects in UI Aligned Camera mode now preserves their distance, rather than snapping it to the plane
- Context Menu now opens around the current cursor position in UI Aligned Camera mode

- Added ability to change Group names (requested by ChrisWarner103 (DelVR), ToMo (DelVR) and others in the past)
-- This can be done on a request to team member and shouldn't be done often
-- Note that the internal ID "G-GroupName" will remain unchanged

- Neos now properly imports texture wrap modes from Assimp when importing 3D models (based on feedback by uyjulian)
-- Note that Assimp doesn't read the wrap modes correctly in all cases, so this won't fix all cases of them being incorrect
Tweaks:
- Captured photos that aren't 360 now default the texture to Clamp mode, instead of Repeat (based on feedback by Earthmark, ProbablePrime and H3BO3)
- Tweaked defaults of Context Menu and general UIX Z-write materials to fix more issues with Z-fighting, particularly in desktop mode
- MirrorTransform component is now categorized under Transform/Drivers (suggested by Komdog)
- Imported rig bones colliders now have names in format "<bone type/name> Collider" to avoid confusion (suggested by ProbablePrime)
- When dragging LogiX wire in the UI Aligned Camera mode, the wire point is positioned exactly at the cursor now
- You can now zoom closer in UI Aligned Camera mode, making it easier to fill the screen with small pictures or video players (based on feedback by Psychpsyo)

Bugfixes:
- When focused UI is currently parented under the user (e.g. Context Menu or grabbed UI) it won't be focused on to avoid undesired behavior with camera flying off (Shifty | Quality Control Lead, Cyro, Aegis_Wolf | Creative Director and others)
- Interaction origin and direction is now based on the actual view, rather than the laser origin on user's hand
-- This fixes UI's (Inspector's, Context Menus and others) not being interactable when the user is behind them, e.g. in UI Aligned Camera mode (reported by Shifty | Quality Control Lead)
- Changing user's username now also updates the cached username in all submitted worlds
