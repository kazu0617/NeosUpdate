Hello everyone, sorry for another small build, the weekly update took a bit today instead! ^^; Some more goodies though, the default Neos head and hands avatar has been updated! It's now all our custom design and the assets have been more optimized as well. We will probably do some more tweaks on them as it goes live and we find more issues, so let us know what you think!

The Motion Blur is now also configurable on the in-game Cameras! The Intractive Camera control now exposes both Screen Space Reflections and Motion Blur as settings too, so you can adjust them based on your liking/needs.

I've added some options for configuring how are motion vectors for objects generated as well. If you have rapidly moving objects in your worlds that shouldn't be blurred, you can now disable it specifically for those - do not apply it on everything though, otherwise you'll cause problems with antialiasing, eggs, AO and other things!

There are some more tweaks and additions too, more to come soon!
New Features:
- Added new custom default Neos VR headset head avatar (created by @Ryuvi | Technical Artist)
-- This is a more optimized model with custom design that displays user's profile picture on the front
- Updated default Neos hands (redesigned by @Ryuvi | Technical Artist)
-- These use more optimized geometry (previously requested by @H3BO3, @Turk and @Alex from Alaska)

- Added Motion Blur and Screen Space Reflections settings to the Camera component and the Interactive Camera control settings (based on feedback by @DAWKY, @Robyn (QueenHidi) and @Rukio)
- Added MotionVectorMode to MeshRenderer components, which allows controlling how are motion vectors generated (based on feedback by @Toxic_Cookie, @Snooper, @Shadow Panther [RU/EN, UTC+3], Helix-9 and others)
-- You can set it to following options:
--- Object - object's motion will generate blur)
--- Camera - only camera motion relative to object will generate blur
--- NoMotion - motion vectors are always zero
-- For rapidly moving objects that are causing excessive unwanted blurring, it's recommended to switch this to "Camera" mode
-- IMPORTANT: that this is only suitable to fine tune motion blur when it's active for problematic objects, it's STRONGLY not recommended to set this for everything to disable motion blur, as motion vectors are used for many other effects (antialiasing, AO and others) and you WILL cause graphical artifacts by doing so. If you want to disable motion blur completely use the on-camera option

- Added MaxRowSize property to AvatarBadgeManager, which allows controlling at how many badges a new row will be added (default is 12)
Tweaks:
- "Save To Inventory" menu option will no longer appear when grip equipping tooltips (based on suggestion by @Beaned)
- Opening dash and other actions that block input will no longer interrupt crouching and other double-tap toggled actions (based on report by @Psychpsyo and @Zaravi)
- Default DistanceSpace for AudioOuput is now local (suggested by @Shifty | Quality Control Lead)
-- This will make the range of newly created audio sources scale with the object
-- Existing instances of AudioOutput are unaffected 

- Merged Korean locale additions by @MirPASEC
- Merged Czech locale additions by @rampa_3 (UTC +1, DST UTC +2)
- Merged Japanese locale additions and tweaks by @Aesc
- Merged Russian locale addition and English locale fix by @Shadow Panther [RU/EN, UTC+3]

Optimizations:
- Added memory pooling when updating name badges, to reduce GC pressure and CPU usage
- Optimized setting up user badges on spawned users, to run the setup process only once after all badges were registered, rather than rerunning it for every single badge added

Bugfixes:
- Fixed MTC tutorial text mentioning "Ctrl+S" combination for the new desktop mode instead of the Context menu (fixed by @Rue Shejn | Artist 3D)

Known Issues:
- Motion Blur of objects behind UI causes the UI itself to become blurry
