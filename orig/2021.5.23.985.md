Another small build before I start focusing on some bigger things, but hopefully with some nice goodies! There's a bunch of new LogiX node overloads for vector and boolean vector types, which should give you a whole bunch of extra flexibility when working with those datatypes.

The new WIP Neos Account website (also used for OAuth) now also has some basic Neos branding to look less sketchy thanks to @ProbablePrime.

And there's a pretty important bugfix (technically two internally) for text rendering, which should fix some text being glitched out and wrapped incorrectly in some cases (see #ðŸŽ¥devlog for sample video), improving the overall robustness of our text rendering system.

New Features:
- Added bitwise overloads of logical operators for boolean vectors (bool2, bool3, bool4) and integer vectors (int2, int3, long4...) (requested by @art0007i)
- Added bit shift and bit rotate overloads for boolean vectors (bool2, bool3 and bool4) (requested by @art0007i)
- Added vector comparison operator nodes (requested by @art0007i)
-- These produce boolean vectors. E.g. if you compare two float3 values, you get bool3, with each component being compared independently
- Added "Cosine" curve shape preset (requested by Dirko3000)
-- This starts slow and ramps up to full speed
- Added bobool3ol
Tweaks:
- Neos Account / Auth website (https://auth.neos.com/) now has basic Neos branding and style (implemented by @ProbablePrime, based on request from @Geenz | Graphics Programmer)
-- Internal layouts were centralized
-- Swapped the Nav Bar to Dark and added the Neos Round Logo.
-- Website is now labeled "Neos Account Website" instead of internal project name "CloudX.Account"
-- External login providers were removed for now
-- Patreon and Main Website links now link to separate websites rather than dummy pages

Bugfixes:
- Fixed cloud not providing proper response code when synchronizing records and there are too many requests at the time, resulting in unecessary sync errors, rather than retry logic being employed properly
- Fixed text layout computing the longest word width incorrectly when multiple text segments are used (e.g. formatting), resulting in horizontal auto-scale producing wrong values in some cases and some words being forcefully wrapped (based on report and sample by @Enverex)
- Fixed text auto-size layout using some auto-sized values from previous run when the text is being changed, resulting in random non-persistent layout glitches (words being wrapped incorrectly, lines being randomly spaced wrong) (based on report and sample by @Enverex)
- Fixed ValueMultiplexer and ReferenceMultiplexer still throwing exceptions in some cases when the index is out of bounds due to off by one error (based on report by @Enverex)
