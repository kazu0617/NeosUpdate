2021.2.4.348
Small hotfix for the new parent streaming sometimes producing invalid offsets (e.g. some user anchors making the user too big/small or offseting them incorrectly). Sorry it took so long, it took a bit to trace it down and I ended up having to rework the math for it!

Compatible with previous build, but if you or other users are on the old one, you still might get incorrect behavior until everyone updates.

Tweaks:
- Merged Japanese, Esperanto and Chinese locale additions by @Melnus
- Merged French locale addition by @brodokk
- Merged Korean locale additions by @MirPASEC
- Merged Czech locale addition by @rampa_3 (UTC +1, DST UTC +2)

Bugfixes:
- Reworked transform offset math for TransformStreamDriver so it always produces correct offsets with the new space streaming system
-- This fixes avatar anchors and other behaviors that translate/rotate/scale user after parenting them resulting in invalid offsets or scale (reported by @Furf, @chemicalcrux, tested by @Shifty | Quality Control Lead, @chemicalcrux and @Tatsu Kimiero)
- Added guards against invalid/degenerate rotation and scale offsets to TransformStreamDriver to prevent potential misbehavior
