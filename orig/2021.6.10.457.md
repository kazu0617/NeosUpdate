2021.6.10.457
Hello everyone, just another small build to push a few additions, tweaks and bugfixes out. most of the work still goes into BEPUv2 integration, but hopefully these help!

There's some extra goodies for Context Menu Injection, improvements for SteamVR detection and controller handling and some bugfixes to audio system breaking in some cases.

New Features:
- Added "IsContextMenuOpen" LogiX node (under LogiX/Interaction) that indicates whether given user has their context menu open or not (requested by @3x1t_5tyl3)
-- By default it assumes the local user (one evaluating the node)
- Added "AllowDrag" to ContextMenuItemSource which will prevent the button interaction from stopping when moving the pointer (based on feedback by @3x1t_5tyl3)
-- This allow you to receive the button pressing events more easily
Tweaks:
- When SteamVR is detected to be currently running, the Oculus Runtime will be skipped during Autodetect initialization (based on feedback by @Groxxy but Face Tracking lul and @H3BO3)
-- This should improve issues when launching Neos from SteamVR bigscreen or when trying to use trackers with Oculus devices
- On Linux, the Oculus runtime initialization is skipped during Autodetection since it's not supported
- ButtonValueShift<T> now multiplies quaternions rather than adding them, resulting in correct rotation offsets (based on report by @Shifty | Quality Control Lead)
- Neos will now remap new Left/Right controllers in SteamVR when they're introduced to the system, allowing you to swap to another pair of controllers without rebooting (based on feedback by @Sox)
-- Note that this is currently untested, so it might misbehave, please report any issues
- Merged extra MTC Streaming & Recording Hall English locale strings from @Rue Shejn | Artist 3D

- Merged Japanese locale additions for the MTC Streaming & Recording Hall by @Aesc

Bugfixes:
- Added validation to AudioOutput parameters to prevent audio system from breaking when fed invalid parameters (e.g. NaN, infinities and so on) (reported by @Kisaki and @MattyK)
- Fixed material inspector incorrectly configuring the locale string, showing "waiting" instead of the actual string and throwing exception in the background (reported by @Shadow Panther [RU/EN, UTC+3], @H3BO3, @AshtonSparx, @Enverex , @3x1t_5tyl3 and others)
