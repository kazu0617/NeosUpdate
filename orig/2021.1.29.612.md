Another quick hotfix that should fix certain behaviors breaking that depend on internally duplicating components, breaking some UIX canvases as result. I'm sorry for the inconvenience!

Compatible with previous build.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed duplication mechanism registering no-copy references for copying, causing duplicating and other processing that collects those references to break
-- This fixes some operations and flows with UIX canvases causing the canvas to break (reported by @Raith (CytraX) and @3x1t_5tyl3)
