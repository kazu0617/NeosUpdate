2021.3.9.130
Hello everyone, got another important update to the new desktop mode, you can now grab and click things! It will even pose the avatar hand to make it look more natural. Everything is in quite early state so it's a bit rough and raw, as the focus is more on designing the underlying interaction mechanisms and building them out, but more polish will come soon. Hopefully it should significantly improve the usability of the mode in its current state though!

Sorry there's only few of other things in this build, there's a few bugfixes and tweaks as well, but my main focus was on getting more of the desktop mode going and dealing with some background things.

New Features:
- Added initial version of desktop interaction system, allowing for clicking and grabbing in the new desktop mode
-- Current bindings are as follows (note that these are pre-liminary and will likely change as we go):
--- Left Mouse button / Right gamepad trigger to click/touch
--- Right Mouse button / Right gamepad bumper to grab/hold
--- Delete key to destroy grabbed
--- Insert key to duplicate grabbed
-- The interaction laser is used as a base, with the laser portion hidden and the cursor centered at the screen
-- Please note that this is still in heavy development and a lot more behaviors & polish is coming

- Added initial version of hand interaction posing system, which will pose the avatar hands when interacting with items
-- This provides a visual feedback to other users when a desktop user is interacting (e.g. clicking or grabbing items)
-- Note that currently the posting is still quite rudimentary and will be expanded and polished in the future builds
- You can now use mouse scroll for the in-world interfaces by hovering over them in the new desktop mode
- Added locomotion turn bindings to gameapads (based on feedback of Iforgotwhosorry ;_;)
-- Those are only active while in VR, in desktop mode they're overriden by the camera look controls which turn the player implicitly

Tweaks:
- Added exponentiation (default 4) to gamepad look sensitivity, to allow for better precision with fine movements
- Laser reticle now scales based on the distance from the view for the owner, to make sure it's still legible even when interacting with far away objects
- Screen inputs now update before everything else, ensuring that no behaviors (e.g. avatar IK) lag behind its movements a frame behind
- Added "(for 7 days)" to "Remember Me" option in the login dialog (based on feedback by @drecalen#2829)
-- This is to avoid confusion on users getting logged out after a week of inactivity
- Tweaked update order for laser, fixing cases where the laser would be slightly jittery even when stationary
- VR -> Desktop transition is now skipped if the user is already in desktop mode and starts/joins a new world

- Merged Korean locale addition by @MirPASEC
- Merged Japanese, Esperanto and Chinese locale additions & changes by @Melnus
- Merged Russian locale additions & tweaks by @Shadow Panther [RU/EN, UTC+3]
- Merged Czech locale additions & tweaks by @rampa_3 (UTC +1, DST UTC +2)
Bugfixes:
- Fixed nametags going semi-transparent when the user is in the desktop mode
- Headless will no longer list and allow focusing of the Userpace world, preventing operations from being executed on it (based on report by @Glitch)
- Fixed headless hanging when running commands with improperly quoted strings and reworked parsing logic to allow for inclusion of quotes in the argument itself (reported by @Glitch)
- LogixTip now uses the bendy laser hit when restoring broken input nodes, fixing cases where custom tooltips would block the raycast when refreshing broken LogiX nodes (reported by @Hayden, @Shifty | Quality Control Lead and @Epsilion)

Known Issues:
- The actual laser offset on the hand is not currently respected, resulting in the laser being bent even at rest and the hand getting into the face when moving item too close
- You can't use context menus properly yet (they'll spawn in incorect location)
- If you equip a tool, desktop interactions might not work correctly
- If you bring item too close it'll get physically grabbed/equipped
- Many more interactions are still missing, please remember that the desktop mode is currently in heavy development
