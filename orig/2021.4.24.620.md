2021.4.24.620
Hello everyone! Sorry this build took a while, there were a few things that took a fair bit longer. One of the major additions is that our cloud backend now supports OAuth 2.0! This has a whole bunch of preliminary work and there's still a bunch to do, but the basics are there now and can be built upon. Currently the registrations are on manual approval, we'll have more formal process once it's further developed.

Some important improvements and additions were made to the third person mode, which should now feel better to use, as you have manual control over the character looking at the camera when it's in front (holding right mouse button without cursor being active) and you can keep the look locked in the whole time with the button!

Another major improvement is that the internal local database system API has been reworked to use async/await pattern, instead of synchronous locks. This should help significantly with the background threads all being locked up by the database, causing UI and other things to stop updating in a lot of cases. It required a bunch of other API's and method to be rewritten to async/await, but from testing with Danger Tester's, it seems pretty good so far!

Also the audio crackling issue should be fixed too when using the Audio Output Device in settings, sorry for the issues being kept so long!
New Features:
- Implemented OAuth 2.0 support to Neos cloud service, allowing granting limited access to your Neos account to external services (requested by Geenz | Graphics Programmer on behalf of VBLFC, also based on request by Avinash | WeMakeVR for the Metamovie project and other requests in the past)
-- A brand new ASP.Net Core based website has been implemented for the Neos Cloud backend, currently available at https://cloudx-account.azurewebsites.net/, but only provides basic login and password changing functionality
-- Currently Authorization Code Flow is implemented (thanks to suggestions and advice from ProbablePrime)
-- Registering applications is currently on manual approval only. If you'd like to start building applications, contact us with details. You can reach out at helloneos.com for now.
-- Only basic profile information is currently available, with more scopes and features to come over time

- Improved behavior for character head aligning in third person mode to give better control
-- When the camera is in front of the character, the character no longer looks at the camera by default
-- By holding the right mouse button while the laser is not active, you can force the character to keep looking at the camera. If the camera is currently in front, the character will keep their front towards the camera
-- Holding the right mouse button will keep the facing direction locked in even when walking
-- Interval before turning back when walking in the direction of the camera view has been significantly lowered
- Added MaximumNormalizedSpeed to PhysicalLocomotion to allow limiting maximum speed based on user input (requested by orange)
-- Default is 2, which corresponds to running with both joysticks
-- Setting this to 1 will not allow "running", even when both joysticks are used
- Added VideoTextureAssetMetadata which provides metadata for VideoTexture assets (requested by Kal)
- Added ITexture2DAssetMetadata which provides shared metadata for 2D texture types (Texture2D and VideoTexture) (based on request above)

Tweaks:
- Vive Tracker ID's in world are now anonymized, instead of using the actual hardware ID (based on report by ProbablePrime and Snooper)
-- The tracker name is still consistent between sessions, but will change when the local database is cleared
-- Existing full body mapping should be unaffected. However any mappings based on the displayed name in World will break
- Improved security of the login tokens (based on feedback by ProbablePrime)
- Additional notification sounds are now supressed if too many play at once in a very short timespan
-- This prevents overly loud sounds when receiving multiple messages at the same time (reported by Robyn (QueenHidi), Shifty | Quality Control Lead and Shadow Panther [RU/EN, UTC+3])
- ToString node is now also categoried in String category (suggested by Epsilion and Electronus)
- Pressing the object root navigation button in the inspector will now also automatically jump to the LogiX node if it's present and closer (based on requested by 3x1t_5tyl3 and Epsilion)
- Removed obsolete PersistentTransform component (note that this means that legacy world switcher will now reset its position on each startup)
- When one of the eyes is closed / not tracking, it will use the direction from the other one (based on report by Kulza, Cyro and Shifty | Quality Control Lead)
- Merged new English MTC and Mirror strings by Rue Shejn | Artist 3D
- Merged Swedish locale additions and updates by Tako, Nestorboy and Coffee
- Merged Esperanto locale additions (including new MTC) and tweaks by Inferus
- Merged Dutch locale additions (including new MTC) and tweaks by AnotherFoxGuy
- Merged German locale fixes by 3x1t_5tyl3
- Merged Japanese locale tweaks by Aesc and かず (kazu / GitHub: kazu0617)
- Merged Finnish locale fix by Napo
- Merged Korean locale fixes by MirPASEC

Bugfixes:
- Rewrote the local database API to use async/await with async locks, rather than synchronous locks (based on report by AshtonSparx)
-- This should significantly reduce UI locking up due to background threads being locked
- Fixed glitchy/crackling audio when using the Audio Output Device configured in the Settings (reported by Zane, kleinlowe#2600, chemicalcrux, H3BO3, Shadow Panther [RU/EN, UTC+3], Knifa and others)
- Headless accounts are now always forced to Online status, fixing cases where they get accidentally set to Invisible, making the sessions not appear (based on report by Medra)
- Fixed third person camera offset reset being a single right mouse click instead of double click
- Fixed FindChildByName node always ignoring case when matching substring, even when told not to (reported by Psychpsyo)
-- Existing instances will have True input node automatically plugged into IgnoreCase if they are setup with MatchSubsting (based on report by Shifty | Quality Control Lead and Cyro)
- Removed obsolete ModelViz application
- Fixed detection of eye tracking data validity, which caused eye direction to be updated after the tracking was already lost
-- This fixes the eyes jumping around as the eyes are closed (based on report by Kulza, Cyro and Shifty | Quality Control Lead)

One more hotfix, found what was causing the connectivity issues (notably with headless). Compatible with current, but if you're hosting worlds, you should update ASAP.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed NAT punchthrough generating tokens that are too large, causing the mechanism to reject the tokens, making people unable to join (reported by 朱繕, Shadow Panther [RU/EN, UTC+3], guheheP and MirPASEC)
