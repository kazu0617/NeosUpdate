2021.6.14.1204
Another patch, fixing a few more things that got broken! Also an extra new feature to give more flexibility when controlling headless world access with cloud variables (including custom deny message)! Check #devlog for a sample.

Compatible with previous build, but obviously you (and potentially the host) need to update if you want the fixes!

New Features:
- Added denyUserCloudVariable to world startup configuration, which allows denying join access to users via a cloud variable
-- This functions similarly to allowUserCloudVariable, except when the value for given user is true, they will be denied access
-- This always takes precedence over other variables
- Added requiredUserJoinCloudVariable to world startup configuration, which requires a cloud variable to be set to true for given user so they can join
-- You can set a custom deny message via requiredUserJoinCloudVariableDenyMessage
-- If the variable isn't set to true for given user, they won't be allowed access
-- Setting the variable to true won't automatically grant access (unlike allowUserCloudVariable) and will still need to pass other rules - public access, session user limit and so on
-- allowUserCloudVariable takes precedence over this one, allowing to always allow given user access
-- This variable is useful for controlling access to a session, without bypassing the session max user limit and providing a custom message (requested by @Geenz | Graphics Programmer on behalf of VBLFC)
