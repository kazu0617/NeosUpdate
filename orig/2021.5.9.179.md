2021.5.9.179
Hello guys, another small patch, fixing up some critical issues! Notably Contacts+ not working in some cases (I think this should be the last of it now), messages not loading and some logspam with procedural assets.

Build is compatible with the last two, so update at your own leisure! You'll definitely need to update if you want Contacts+ to work reliably though.

Tweaks:
- When procedural asset encounters an exception, it will stop updating and replace the asset with an error proxy (e.g. error texture)
-- If you encounter this, please send logs, as exceptions mean there are problems that need to be fixed!
-- You will need to respawn the component for it to resume operation
-- This will also prevent log-spam on continually changing assets (reported by Enverex)
- Added extra logging information to exceptions thrown from procedural assets
- Small CPU and memory optimizations when fetching messages from the cloud and making other API requests

Bugfixes:
- Fixed connecting to Contacts+ sessions randomly not working due to certain token symbols not being encoded properly (reproted and logs provided by Shifty | Quality Control Lead, AshtonSparx, Raith (CytraX))
- Fixed fetching of unread messages causing inefficient database queries, due to fetching sent messages as well, resulting in the initial fetch failing when cloud is under load, resulting in the users not receiving any messages (based on report and logs by Ho'polis and Wolfie)
- User status sessions are now null when the user is online, but Invisible, fixing exploit allowing to differentiate if user is really Offline or Invisible (reported by Blaze)
