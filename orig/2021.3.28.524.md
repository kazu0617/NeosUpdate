Hello everyone! Sorry for another smaller build, but this one has pretty significant change - the new desktop mode is now default and usable without VR!

I did another pass on the keybinds as well, they have been changed quite a bit and should be closer to what fits with Neos the most. I'm sorry that it's going to mess up with your muscle memory (it does with mine too), but I wanted to make sure we have a good set for what Neos is, rather than haphazardly chosen ones.

Notably the locomotion ones were changed, which are now similar to Minecraft - Shift for "sneak" (slow movement) and double tap directional keys (WASD) to run. Using Space (jump) and C (crouch) in Fly/Noclip now also moves you up and down.

There's still lots of work and tweaks to do on the desktop mode, this doesn't mean it's quite finished yet, but I felt it's enough for the swap. The old one is still available as "Legacy Screen" for the time being if you need/want to use it (but prepare for it going poof at some point in the future).

Some work went into cleanup of initialization and postprocessing issues too, I managed to find reason why the streamer camera and in-game ones didn't have a working motion blur effect, so it's finally back! Also some other bugfixes, notably for the audio stopping with Unity Native video playback when switching URL, sorry for the trouble!
New Features:
- The new desktop mode is now the default mode!
-- Launching Neos with "Screen" or AutoDetect without VR device will use the new desktop mode
-- Old debugging mode is available as "Legacy Screen" -LegacyScreen for the time being, but remains officially unsupported
-- Please note that this doesn't mean that the new desktop mode is finished, there's still a lot that will come to it
-- Note that we're also still updating associated materials like the tutorials and descriptions

- Neos now uses VSync by default in the new desktop mode, preventing running at unconstrainted framerate and wasting GPU performance (prevously requested by かず (kazu / GitHub: kazu0617), Shadow Panther [RU/EN, UTC+3] and others)

- Added MinInputCloseness and MaxInputCloseness to EyeLinearDriver
-- These allow adjusting the range of input values that the eye closing responds to. This can be used to tweak the range so the eyes stay fully open even when partially closed (e.g. due to eye tracking issues, as reported by Rukio)
Tweaks:
- Shift key is now used to slow down movement
- You can run by double tapping any of the movement keys (WASD)
- Space & C on keyboard and A/LeftBumper on gamepad (jump & crouch) are now also used to move up and down in Fly/NoClip
- Up/Down movement is now relative to the user's space, rather than the head (e.g. looking straight down and holding Space will move you upwards, instead of forward)
- Desktop Interaction Relay now ignores interactions when in the new desktop mode
- The LOD bias is now automatically switched when toggling between VR and Desktop mode
- Save To Inventory and Save Screenshot items now have distinct icons and colors

- Merged rewording of ban buttons in the Contacts menu in the English locale by Polaris (she/her)
- Merged Korean locale addition by MirPASEC
- Merged Japanese locale addition by Aesc
- Merged Czech locale addition and tweaks by rampa_3 (UTC +1, DST UTC +2)
Bugfixes:
- Fixed Motion Blur not working on non-VR cameras or in Desktop mode when VR is running
- Fixed Ambient Occlusion trying to treat non-VR cameras as VR when VR is running, resulting in incorrect behavior
- Fixed VideoTextureProvider stopping audio playback after the URL has changed or when the video loops (reported by Rukio, Turk, Alex from Alaska)
- VRIK now respects the Enabled property even when updated externally (e.g. from VRIKAvatar)
-- This fixes regression where some behaviors that depend on disabling the IK would no longer work (reported by Dante and Turk)
