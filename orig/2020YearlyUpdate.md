Hello everyone and welcome to our third yearly update! We hope everyone had a great new year and enjoyed the festivities, whether in Neos or elsewhere.


Watching the New Year fireworks as the number of concurrent users kept climbing towards our all-time record.

With 2020 over, it’s a good time to take a look back at the last year and see where we’ll be going for this one. With the global pandemic, it was a challenging year for everyone, but also one where many people came together to work through the new challenges and we’re happy that our platform could be part of this.

The 2018 year, when we officially released Steam in May, was signified by a spark, a metaphor for everyone who joined and supported the platform in its infancy, when it was just a pile of code with no active community. The first few people have sparked what’s now the core of our community and helped us shape some crucial parts of the platform to make it more interesting to more users.

The following year 2019 that spark grew into a flame, with the community growing and bringing more users as well as Neos getting more crucial features, improving avatar expressivity, supporting a wide variety of hardware, building crucial frameworks to build other features on top of and improving general usability of Neos. It was a year that really set the ball rolling.

Over 2020 we saw the fruits of that development, as the community grew in size over the course of the year. Our main focus on making Neos more accessible to new users by redesigning the UI and UX, fixing and tweaking many interactions to remove common frustrations and overall improving accessibility and power of Neos.

With every improvement we saw the community grow more and more users become regulars. The worlds, gadgets, tools and other content kept getting more elaborate and clever as the time went, bringing out more of the creative freedom that Neos offers and showing it to wider audiences on many platforms.

Our community has also come together to support development of Neos, by helping out with onboarding new users, resolving issues, reporting issues, bugs and feature requests, translating the interface, documenting everything on the Wiki and more.

The financial support of Patreon and our ICO also grew significantly, reaching a very important milestone. During 2019 we were still losing money every month and using up our original seed investment. It was a particularly challenging period, as we weren’t sure how much longer our runway would last and we were trying to conserve as many resources as possible.

Thanks for the overwhelming support in 2020, we have finally become self sufficient. Thanks to everyone’s support, we no longer have to worry whether we are going to survive, but we can focus more on how we’re going to grow, both the platform, the community and our team.

Because of this, we have decided to use bonfire as the symbol to represent 2020, with every user who registered during this year getting it as their badge. The bonfire symbolizes the community coming together, with everyone putting a log into the fire, helping it grow and sustain itself.

 

There’s a bit of a silly interpretation of the symbolism as well. If you’ve ever submitted a bug report, you might know we often ask for log files, or “logs” for short to help diagnose the issue. And there are also “logs” in the bonfire… You get the point! ;)

The year wasn’t without its challenges for us either. We didn’t get to implement a lot of things that we wanted to this year, while we implemented some others that we didn’t even think of last year. Many of the issues became more challenging than expected and managing the growth of the community and rising number of bug reports and feature requests put a wrench in a few things a few times as well.

But regardless we keep on moving forward, learning from the challenges and our mistakes and doing what we can to improve the platform every day. We have a lot planned for the next year and the following years, but we’re also prepared to adapt based on the changing needs of the community and our team to keep the project going forward. Let’s have a look at some of the highlights of this year.
