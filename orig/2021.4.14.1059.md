Hello everyone! Sorry this took a while, I've had a few high priority things to deal with over past several days. Particularly dealing with the issues with Patreon API causing more and more people to not get their rewards on time (or at all, requiring manual corrections), so I ended up biting a bullet and rewrote part of the integration to use a newer, more reliable part of their API.

This took a few days to do fully, partly due to a lot of manual verifications (this is not a system you want to mess up!), but the good news is that the integration should now be much smoother, getting you your rewards sooner and requiring a lot less work on our end that distracts from the development! :smile:

The big thing in this update is the 3rd person camera mode for the new desktop! It has all the interactions and should be fully usable, though there's still more things and polish to come to it, but hopefully you'll have fun playing with it already! There's a lot of underlying work that went into making work, particularly making things behave when the view and head positions are decoupled (this is crucial for the upcoming freeform camera for editing) and adding various mechanisms to enable communication between different systems (e.g. the avatar turning only when moving from the locomotion module).

There are some business oriented features too (mostly internal now), like supporting adding custom splash screen or auto-starting up worlds with a config file (you can use this one yourself too).

Also some tweaks and fixes as usual, some rig heuristics issues should be fixed now and the scale gizmo is usable in the projection mode too.
New Features:
- Implemented initial version of third person camera mode for the new desktop
-- You can toggle between first person and third using the Alt key (this will change soon. Currently not persistent across worlds either.)
-- By clicking the left mouse button you can activate laser, which will slide the camera slightly to the side and allow you to aim
-- Interactions with tools, items, grabbing and context menus are supported with above
-- When stationary and not interacting, you can orbit the camera around the character to look from the front
-- You can hold Ctrl+Right Mouse Button to adjust the camera offset (horizontal and distance) (if you offset the camera sufficiently, it won't auto-offset on interaction)
-- Hold Ctrl and double click the Right Mouse Button to reset the camera offset
-- There are more features and camera modes to come, it's not complete yet!

- Implemented a proper projection algorithm for global scale gizmo, so objects can be scaled down, not just up (based on report by @DeliriousJax, @Shadow Panther [RU/EN, UTC+3] and @ProbablePrime)
-- This method is analogous to the uniform scale gizmo in tools like Unity. Moving in positive direction (usually right/up) will scale up, moving in the opposite direction scales down

- Implemented ability to setup a custom startup splash screen (requested by @Karel | CEO, @VRxist and others)
-- This is mainly for custom branded commercial builds and needs to be setup on our end
- UniverseID, NoUI mode and auto-startup world can now be configured using the Config.json file
- Auto startup worlds/sessions can now be configured in the Config.json file (based on request by (requested by @Karel | CEO and @VRxist)
-- Syntax is the same as the headless startup worlds (minus headless specific parameters, like locally saving, auto-invite, auto-recover and similar)
- Added ability to specify custom config file with commandline argument using -Config <filename>
- Added hidden _useProjectionInVR configuration to LogiX tooltip, which allows disabling the new projection interaction when in VR (based on feedback by @ProbablePrime)

- Rewrote part of the Patreon integration to count the total support on Neos' end, rather than relying on the same value provided by Patreon API
-- This fixes many issues with getting rewards in-game - minting NCR, getting the right tier and storage space due to the precomputed Patreon API values growing more unreliable over time
-- The system now automatically matches the latest pledged tier, fixing cases where the wrong tier was activated due to the pledge not matching the tier exactly (e.g. $14 for the $12 tier)
-- This also fixes some unreliability and issues when using currencies other than USD.
--- Please note that using currency other than USD will mint NCR matching exactly to the tier you selected, even if you pledge more than that. Pledging in USD will still mint the exact amount pledged.
--- If you pledge in currency other than USD, you also need to select a tier, otherwise you will not get your rewards
-- The new API endpoint also provides most up to date data, which should result in the rewards being distributed much sooner after beginning of the month
-- If you find any discrepancies or issues with your account, please let us know!

Tweaks:
- You can now use the Delete key again to destroy grabbed objects as alternative to Ctrl+Shift+D (@Lewis Snow | Lead Audio Engineer, @Turk, @ohzee, @AshtonSparx, @Robyn (QueenHidi), @Psychpsyo and others)
- Slightly increased the interval of tapping the C key to toggle crouch (based on report by @epicEaston197)
- You can now use the T key to open the context menu in addition to the Middle Mouse Button (this is useful on laptops where it's difficult to do a middle mouse click)
- LAN session discovery now respects the world's UniverseID and doesn't display worlds that belong to different universes
- Out of touch angle filtering for TouchSource is now based on the actual viewpoint rather than the head
-- This fixes interfaces not being interactable in VR and desktop when the view position is overriden
- Input binding system input groups will no longer block each other's inputs if they have exactly the same priority
-- This fixes regression where only one AnchorLocomotionData worked and provided inputs (reported by @ProbablePrime)
- Improved robustness of message sending, preventing them from being successfully marked as sent, despite being correctly sent out
- Notification sounds now ignore reverb zones (requested by @Robyn (QueenHidi) and @Rukio)

- Merged German locale additions and fixes (including new MTC strings) by @3x1t_5tyl3
- Merged Czech locale additions by @rampa_3 (UTC +1, DST UTC +2)
- Merged Russian locale additions and fixes by @Shadow Panther [RU/EN, UTC+3]
- Merged Korean locale additions by @MirPASEC
- Merged Japanese locale additions by @Aesc
Bugfixes:
- Fixed Context Menus not autodismissing in VR when the hand is moved verly quickly while opening the context menu
- Fixed reticle sticking to a grabbed Draggable object (e.g. Slider or Joint) when trying to interact with the context menu
- Fixed regression bone/blendshape name heuristics detecting incorrect chirality for some names (particularly names starting with uppercase L like "LowerArm_Right"), resulting in rigs not importing correctly (reported and sample model provided by @ohzee, @Shifty | Quality Control Lead, @H3BO3, @Turk and @200Tigersbloxed)
- Fixed Paste From Clipboard button not working when desktop tab is currently active and focused on the dash, due to the desktop taking the active focus
- Fixed Userspace having two instances of ScreenModeController, resulting in potentially odd behaviors
- Fixed overwritten worlds getting the owner display name from the overwrite source, rather than keeping the original (reported by several people before)
-- Records already in the cloud are currently being corrected and should be done within the day
- Fixed dynamic bone chains and other behaviors that query hips/feet positions breaking when trackers are deleted from user root (reported by @AshtonSparx, @Readun and @Tekno Catron)
- Fixed unresolved Android compilation error due to new SteamVR version, resulting in Android builds missing (reported by @Karel | CEO)
