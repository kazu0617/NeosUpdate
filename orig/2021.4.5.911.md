2021.4.5.911
Hello everyone, got another batch of new desktop mode improvements and additions! Most notably, the LogiX tooltip is now much easier to use in the new desktop! It has projection interaction for connecting wires that not only works in desktop, but also in VR! There's still more things to come, like UI aligned camera with freeform cursor, which will make it even easier to use, but this should hopefully help quite a bit already!

Some other behaviors were improved as well with many things, from better inspector spawning position, improvements to controls and many bugfixes too for all things around! Also new nodes for easier work with the BodyNode enum!
New Features:
- LogiX tip now supports projection interaction in addition to physical one as well, allowing you to drag and connect LogiX wires from distance
-- This makes LogiX tip significantly easier to use in the new desktop mode
- LogiX tip now also uses projection for deleting wires by crossing them in desktop mode
-- Note that there is small-ish tolerance (currently ~10cm) for the depth of the wires, allowing deleting wires that are at somewhat different depths (the tolerance can be tweaked based on issues)
-- The projection distance is updated anytime a wire is crossed over with a cursor. If the crossing doesn't catch a specific wire, make sure that your cursor hovers over it at some point (I can make this part smarter if this becomes a common problem)

- Added Slerp node overloads for 3D and 4D vectors
- Added listbans command to the headless, which allows listing of all active bans (requested by @Dante)

- Added new nodes for working with BodyNodes under Utility/BodyNode (based on feedback by @Turk)
-- Chirality - gets body node's chirality
-- RelativeBodyNode - gets the body node which is the root of given body node's tracking space
-- FingerNodeIndex - gets the index of the finger node
-- IsEye - is given body node an eye
-- OtherSide - gets the other side for sided body nodes (e.g. left leg will give the right leg)
-- Get Side - gets specific chirality of given body node
-- Finger Type - gets the finger type from a body node (thumb, index, middle, ring and pinky)
-- Finger Segment Type - gets the finger segment type from a body node (metacarpal, proximal, intermediate, distal and tip)
-- ComposeFinger - composes a BodyNode from a finger type, segment type and chirality
Tweaks:
- LogiX tip now spawns new nodes at the location of the screen cursor in the new desktop mode, making working with nodes easier
- Tweaked positioning of spawned inspector from the developer tooltip to be more consistent
-- This heavily improves the positioning when in desktop mode, preventing the inspector from spawning at akward angles and too close to the view
- In-game photos now persist list of users who have exported it within the session
-- This prevents the "Save Screenshot" from reappearing after rejoining a session
- When spawning a photo captured by someone else, the "Save Screenshot" option won't reappear for the user who spawned it
- Grabbed object laser smoothing is reduced when the laser is pointing at a touchable interface (e.g. inspector canvas)
-- This makes it easier to drop in textures, materials and other references to fields in the inspector, without having to waiting too much on the laser to catch up
- Lowered smoothing of the FOV change when running in the desktop mode (based on feedback by @Shifty | Quality Control Lead) 
- WASD double-tap sprinting now keeps the sprint active as long as any of the keys is held, even if the original double-tapped key is released (requested by @Shifty | Quality Control Lead)

- Upgraded to Oculus SDK v25.0 from v19.1 which includes OVRPlugin 1.57.0 (previously 1.55.1)
- Upgraded to SteamVR Plugin 2.7.3 (SDK 1.14.15)

- Merged Korean locale addition by @LUA
Bugfixes:
- Fixed TooltipMultiplexer not passing through OverrideTargetPoint calls, resulting in projection mode on developer tooltip in multi-tools misbehaving (reported by @Shadow Panther [RU/EN, UTC+3], @ItsDusty <PRISM> and @RaiRu <PRISM>)
- Fixed incorrect target distance calculation when in the new desktop mode, resulting in not being able to drop references/textures/materials to inspector from a distance larger than 1 meter (discovered by @Rue Shejn | Artist 3D)
- Potentially fixed mesh renderers becoming visible and/or not having assigned proper materials, blendshapes and other properties when the mesh was previously setup and cleaned up (based on report by @Kal, @Cyro and @Shifty | Quality Control Lead)
- Context Menu will no longer auto-dismiss immediatelly if the cursor isn't inside of it
-- In other words, the cursor needs to be inside of the menu first, before the auto-dismiss behavior activates
-- This fixes the context menu immediatelly closing in some cases due to the cursor not being automatically centered in the screen (e.g. when using gamepad or on Linux where cursor re-centering isn't supported as reported by @Greyfus, @hare_ware and redyoshi49q)
-- This should also fix it being dismissed when the user is moving too fast (reported by @epicEaston197 and @Shadow Panther [RU/EN, UTC+3])
- Interactive Camera will automatically stop mirroring when switched to the desktop mode (reported by @Hayden)
- Audio Streaming Panel now has the audio output placed outside of the UI canvas, preventing it from being too quiet when spatialized due to the canvas scale (reported by @marsmaantje and @Elektrospy)
- Fixed sides of dash not being visible when the display (or Neos window) has a narrow aspect ratio (reported by @hare_ware)
- Fixed log-spam when exception occurs during permission validation (found in a log from @LucasRo7)
- Added extra diagnostics to the AvatarObjectPermissions to help diagnose crash reported by @Nexulan | Community Manager, @LucasRo7, @MAX-KZCLOUD and @ProbablePrime
- Fixed IME input mode not getting activated in the new desktop mode, making it impossible to write certain symbols like Japanese (reported by @Aetoriz)
- Fixed regression in texture variants incorrectly combining point-filtering with billinear and higher, causing textures to not be able to switched to Point filtering if there is another request for the same texture that's Billinear or higher
