Hello everyone, just a small build again since most of the time goes into BEPUv2 now, but here's a few goodies! Most notably you can now import external screenshots (e.g. with Print Screen) as Neos Photos, meaning they get all the metadata (including "Save Screenshot" option) as ones captured in-game! There some improvements for cloud and bunch of bugfixes as well.

New Features:
- Added "Neos Photo" preset for importing images, which will setup the image with metadata as if it was in-game photo
-- Note that the metadata is picked at the moment of import, so it won't be fully accurate. This option is recommended only if you've just captured the screenshot (e.g. with Print Screen or other capture tool)
-- Externally captured photos imported with this option will have the "Save Screenshot" option for other users to allow convenient saving
- FocusedWorldStatus now reports the MaxUsers (implemented by @ProbablePrime | Docs)
- users command on headless now lists the "Silenced" status of the user (requested by @Glitch)

Tweaks:
- You can now use your Neos username or ID to login at auth.neos.com in addition to just the email (requested by @kazu0617 Neos:kazu and @Shifty | Quality Control Lead on behalf of VBLFC)
- Internal moderation tools improvements and bugfixes (based on report by @CanadianGit | Moderation Team on behalf of the moderation team)
- Reverted moderator badge to original
- UIX Canvas sample from "Create New" now has Grabbable on it by default (implemented by @ProbablePrime | Docs)
- Starting playback with speed set to negative will now correctly start playing from the end (e.g. with Play One Shot, based on report by @Shifty | Quality Control Lead)
- Laser is now hidden for other users when the context menu is opened as hidden (based on request by @Psychpsyo)
- Inspectors, Panels, LogiX Node Selector, Full Body Calibrator and Avatar Creator now have object roots (requested by @AshtonSparx)
- Account recovery code email now omits the period in the email to avoid confusion (based on report by @Shifty | Quality Control Lead)
- Account recovery code is now shorter to make it easier to copy & paste or manually type, but it's also valid for 15 minutes instead of 1 hour (after 15 minutes, you'll get a new code)

- Merged Czech locale additions and tweaks by @rampa_3 (UTC +1, DST UTC +2)
- Merged Russian locale addition by @Shadow Panther [RU/EN, UTC+3]
- Merged Korean locale addition by @MirPASEC
- Merged Japanese locale addition by @kazu0617 Neos:kazu

Bugfixes:
- You can now change your password on auth.neos.com when your username contains userspace (reported by @Shadow Panther [RU/EN, UTC+3], fixed by @ProbablePrime | Docs)
-- Note: Many non-unicode characters will still prevent the password from being changed, a proper solution is being investigated
- Fixed Right leg haptics being setup as left leg (reported by @Turk | Mentor Manager, @ALEX VR and @Rue Shejn | Artist 3D)
-- Existing avatars should be automatically fixed, but if you made any customizations for your avatar, you might need to redo them for the right leg
- ContextMenuSubmenu now properly ignores all item sources if they're in the hierarchy of another user (reported by @Psychpsyo)
- Fixed regression causing Spawn methods on RandomObjectSpawner not working (reported by @kazu0617 Neos:kazu and @esnya)
- Fixed ExternalSlotSaver causing crash when the target is currently parent of the slot this component is on (reported by @seif1)

I messed up the condition for fixing the context submenus, causing them to break completely, sorry! ^^; 

Build compatible with previous, but obviously context menu submenus won't work for you unless you update.

Tweaks:
- Reverted the moderator badge to original in Session dialog as well (reported by @Raith (CytraX) | Programmer)

Bugfixes:
- Fixed regression causing context menu submenus not working (reported by @Raith (CytraX) | Programmer, @Ethandarkeco, @Sharkmare and @AshiPaws)

One more hotfix, fixing some regression in playback with negative speed, turns out the original fix made some wrong assumptions, sorry! ^^;

Compatible with last two builds, but some things (mostly audio that's playing in reverse) might not play properly for you without this update.

Bugfixes:
- Reimplemented fix for Play One Shot and other behaviors not working with negative playback, due to the player being freshly instantiated.
-- This fixes some cases of playback with negative speed not working properly after last update (reported by @Sharkmare)
