2021.2.28.1210
Just a small patch for a few things so they don't have to wait on a bigger build! Compatible with last build, no need to update right away if you don't need the fixes.

Tweaks:
- Increased sensitivity of gamepad right thumbstick for camera look control

Bugfixes:
- Fixed screen locomotion axis inputs (e.g. gamepad left thumbstick) being normalized, resulting no lack of analog speed control
- Fixed AvatarExpressionDriver heuristic incorrectly detecting lower lips raising as "Jaw Down"
- Fixed gamepad inputs getting stuck when the gamepad is disconnected (reported by @Shifty | Quality Control Lead)
- Fixed the dash in desktop mode flickering when the user isn't at unit scale (reported by @Lyo, @epicEaston197, @Robyn (QueenHidi), @Cyro and others)
