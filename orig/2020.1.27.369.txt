2021.1.27.369
A hotfix for newly imported meshes not showing up to other users, as well as few other bugfixes and a tweak that I did in the meanwhile.

Compatible with previous build, but if you have people in the session (or the host) on the previous one you'll still have issue with the freshly imported meshes not appearing.

Tweaks:
- Improved string beautify function to avoid splitting multi-digit names (e.g. Projection360 becoming "Projection36 0", as reported by @Rue Shejn | Artist 3D) and add space after single-digit split ("Static Texture 2DProvider" -> "Static Texture 2D Provider")
- Added missing descriptive names to Mobile, Linux and Host badges (based on report by @Epsilion)

- Merged Russian locale additions and fixes by @Shadow Panther [RU/EN, UTC+3]
- Merged Korean locale additions by @MirPASEC
- Merged Japanese locale additions by @かず (kazu / GitHub: kazu0617)
- Merged Esperanto and Chinese locale additions by @Melnus

Bugfixes:
- Fixed P2P asset metadata negotation getting stuck for Mesh and Shader metadata, causing any newly imported meshes to not appear for other users (reported by @Epsilion, @Punapple, @Soylent and @Nexulan | Community Manager)
- Fixed mesh metadata generation throwing exceptions for meshes that have no vertices or invalid indicies
- Fixed exception in AvatarHapticSourceManager when the ActiveUser field is null (found in a log from @Nexulan | Community Manager)
- Fixed DynamicBlendShapeDriver breaking when it's configured with blendshapes that don't exist on the target mesh (found in a log from @Nexulan | Community Manager)
